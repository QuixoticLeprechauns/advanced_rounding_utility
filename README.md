# advanced_rounding_utility
A single function for the advanced rouding of arbitrary values.

# Explanation:
Sometimes rounding in the traditional sense is not applicable to the values you are working with. One such instance is with radians. Although unlikely, you may find yourself in a situation where you must round angles, up or down, to the nearest quarter of Pi (eights of 360 degrees). This simple function is capable of doing that, and so much more.

# More Languages:
Currently, this is only written in C++. I will write this in a few more languages in the future. If you would like to write it in your own favorite language, please share the code!
